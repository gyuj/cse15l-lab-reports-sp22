`Inline code : you use backticks` 

```
# code block how cool
you can either print '3 backticks or'
before and after this block
or print 'indent 4 spaces'
```

*The first lab report is due tomorrow !*
*I can italicize by using these stars before and after*
*No blank spaces though*

**THIS IS BOLD**
**I NEED TWO stars for this**
